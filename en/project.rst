What is Miro?
=============

Miro is a Free Software video player and podcast client: it can play
almost any video file and offers easy access to over 6,000 free
Internet TV shows and video podcasts. You can download from YouTube,
Google Video, Vimeo, DailyMotion, Blip, and more.  You can even save a
search term as a feed and automatically get new videos as they are
posted.

Miro has a simple, gorgeous interface designed for fullscreen HD
video.  Since Miro downloads most videos, you can take your shows with
you---even on an airplane.  Quite simply, Miro is a better way to
watch all the video you care about.

Best of all, Miro is 100% free and open source, developed by
`Participatory Culture Foundation <http://pculture.org/>`_ (a
non-profit organization) and contributors around the world.
