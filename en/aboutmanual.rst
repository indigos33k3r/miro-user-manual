Who it's written for
====================

This manual is written for users of Miro to help them use Miro to do
the things they want to do.


Who wrote it
============

* Janet Dragojevic
* Will Kahn-Greene
* Paul Swartz


How it's written
================

Will Kahn-Greene started writing this manual on a rainy Tuesday
afternoon to answer basic questions that new users of Miro will have.
It will help get users familiar with the interface, answer their basic
"How do I...?" questions, and point them in the right direction if
they have further questions.

It's written using `Emacs`_, `Restructured Text`_, `Sphinx`_, and
various `EtherPad`_ instances..

Screenshots on Linux were taken using `Shutter`_ and edited in
`Gimp`_.  

Screenshots on OSX were taken using `Skitch`_ and edited in
`Gimp`_.
