Miro may recognize media items on websites like YouTube and you will

Clicking on that button will download the item.

Downloading an item
===================

Miro can also download items that aren't in feeds that you've
subscribed to or from video search.

1. Select the **Video** -> **Download Item** menu item.  This will
   launch the **New Download** dialog window.

2. Fill in the url of the item.

   *On Windows and GTKX11 platforms*, you can press Shift+Insert or
   Ctrl+V to paste a url from the system clipboard into this dialog
   box.

   *On OSX*, you can press Apple+V to paste a url from the system
   clipboard into this dialog box.

3. Click on the **OK** button.

Miro will now attempt to download this item.  If the download is
successful, then the item will show up in the sidebar in the **Video**
or **Audio** tab of the **Library** depending on whether the media
item is video or audio.

If the url leads to something that's not a media item, Miro will pop
up a dialog box telling you as such and asking you what you want it to
do.

.. Note::

   Miro can handle YouTube page urls as well.  For example, this url
   is the YouTube page for Nicholas Reville talking about
   Participatory Culture Foundation and Democracy Player (the old name
   for Miro) back in 2006:
